# streamlit_prediction
Diabetes predicting web application developed with the streamlit. We used a data set already available on the internet the link for the data set is as follows 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset
I followed multiple techniques for datacleaning and datapreprocessing and made the data set ideal for the training 
By training and comparing the accuracy of the each algorithm's test and train scenarios I did not witness sufficient variations of accuracy. So there is no overfitting or underfitting.
the codes for that available in the repository in the file diabetesprediction.ipynb.
